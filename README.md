# Dishonored Cheat menu
Simple Cheat menu for Dishonored. Uses ImGui and cazz's memory.h file. Big thanks to cazz (https://github.com/cazzwastaken) for memory.h and incredible ImGui tutorials.

Unlimited Health, Mana, Elixirs.

Add/Remove ammo and resources.

# Features in Development
Remove ability cooldowns.

Infinite ability timers.

# Build
If you'd like to build the project from the source, here is how to do it:

Download the project into its own folder

Use Visual Studio 2022 to open "DishonoredCheatImGui.sln"

At the top of Visual Studio, change the build from Debug to Release (it might already be on Release) and change x64 to x86 or Win32 (again it might already be on x86)

Now you are able to build the project- click on Build at the top-left of visual studio and click Build Solution.

The exe file should appear in a "build" file that wasn't in the folder before.

# Current Bugs/Unintended Features
The application taskbar name is a bunch of Chinese characters (when running, hover over the application on the taskbar).

When displaying the memory addresses of client, player, and inventory, values are in decimal instead of hex.
